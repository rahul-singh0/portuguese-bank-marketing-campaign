# Portuguese Bank Marketing Campaign Insights & Analysis
<h1>Project Overview</h1>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>
    The objective of this project is to analyse the marketing campaigns of a Portuguese bank, focusing on understanding the factors influencing campaign success. By analysing various customer attributes and campaign outcomes, this project aims to uncover insights that can help improve future marketing strategies. The project involves exploring the dataset through data analysis and creating visualisations to interpret key patterns and trends.

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Data preparation, including data cleansing, validation, and transformation using Python and SQL.</li>
    <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including visualisations that show the distribution of campaign success across different demographics, jobs, and months.</li>
    <li>Key insights and recommendations derived from analysing the relationship between customer attributes and campaign success.</li>
    <li>Creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing campaign performance metrics, trends, and key demographic insights.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools and Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>PostgreSQL</b> for storing and managing the cleaned dataset.</li>
    <li><b>Python and SQL</b> for data cleansing and validation (libraries: Pandas, SQL queries).</li>
    <li><b>Python</b> for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualisation (libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).</li>
    <li><b>Power BI</b> for creating interactive dashboards and visualisations.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Project Workflow</h1>
<h2>1. Define Scope and Metrics</h2>
<p>
    The first step of the project was to clearly define the scope and objectives. This involved understanding the problem at hand: predicting whether a customer would subscribe to a term deposit from a marketing campaign. The dataset provided various customer attributes (e.g., age, job, marital status) and campaign outcomes (e.g., whether they subscribed to the term deposit or not). 
</p>
<p>
    The key metric for the project was the binary outcome variable, `y`, which represents whether a customer subscribed to a term deposit ("yes" or "no"). Additionally, I focused on understanding which factors most influenced the likelihood of subscription, including customer demographics, economic conditions, and campaign attributes.
