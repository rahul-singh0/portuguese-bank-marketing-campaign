<h1>Project Workflow</h1>

<h2>1. Define Scope and Metrics</h2>
<p>
    The first step of the project was to clearly define the scope and objectives. This involved understanding the problem at hand: predicting whether a customer would subscribe to a term deposit from a marketing campaign. The dataset provided various customer attributes (e.g., age, job, marital status) and campaign outcomes (e.g., whether they subscribed to the term deposit or not). 
</p>
<p>
    The key metric for the project was the binary outcome variable, `y`, which represents whether a customer subscribed to a term deposit ("yes" or "no"). Additionally, I focused on understanding which factors most influenced the likelihood of subscription, including customer demographics, economic conditions, and campaign attributes.
</p>
<h2>2. Data Preperation</h2>
<h3>2.1 Database Creation and Set Up</h3>

<p>I created a new database called bank_campaign and defined the schema for the bank_marketing_campaign table, aligning it with the datasetâ€™s structure. After setting up the schema, I imported the data using the COPY command, loading the CSV file into the database for analysis.</p>

```sql
CREATE DATABASE bank_campaign;
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE bank_marketing_campaign (
    age INT,
    job VARCHAR(50),
    marital VARCHAR(20),
    education VARCHAR(50),
    "default" VARCHAR(10),
    housing VARCHAR(10),
    loan VARCHAR(10),
    contact VARCHAR(10),
    month VARCHAR(10),
    day_of_week VARCHAR(10),
    duration INT,
    campaign INT,
    pdays INT,
    previous INT,
    poutcome VARCHAR(20),
    emp_var_rate FLOAT,
    cons_price_idx FLOAT,
    cons_conf_idx FLOAT,
    euribor3m FLOAT,
    nr_employed FLOAT,
    y VARCHAR(10)
);
```

```sql
COPY bank_marketing_campaign
FROM '/Users/rahul/Documents/Analyst/Projects/Bank Marketing Campaign/dataset/bank-marketing.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;
```

<h3>2.2 Data Cleansing</h3>

<p>I cleaned the data by removing invalid records with negative values in key fields, checking and removing duplicates, and standardising the case of categorical values. Additionally, I used Python to identify missing values, duplicate rows, and leading or trailing spaces in categorical columns, ensuring the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.</p>

<h4>Removing Invalid Data</h4>

```sql
DELETE FROM bank_marketing_campaign 
WHERE age < 0 OR duration < 0;
```
<h4>Checking for Duplicates</h4>

```sql
SELECT age, job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contact, month, day_of_week, duration, campaign, pdays, previous, emp_var_rate, cons_price_idx, cons_conf_idx, euribor3m, nr_employed, y, COUNT(*) 
FROM bank_marketing_campaign
GROUP BY age, job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contact, month, day_of_week, duration, campaign, pdays, previous, emp_var_rate, cons_price_idx, cons_conf_idx, euribor3m, nr_employed, y
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

DELETE FROM bank_marketing_campaign
WHERE ctid NOT IN (SELECT MIN(ctid)
                    FROM bank_marketing_campaign
                    GROUP BY age, job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contact, month, day_of_week, duration, campaign, pdays, previous, emp_var_rate, cons_price_idx, cons_conf_idx, euribor3m, nr_employed, y);
```

<h4>Updating Inconsistent Values</h4>

```sql
UPDATE bank_marketing_campaign
SET
    emp_var_rate = ROUND(emp_var_rate::numeric, 2),
    cons_price_idx = ROUND(cons_price_idx::numeric, 2),
    cons_conf_idx = ROUND(cons_conf_idx::numeric, 2),
    euribor3m = ROUND(euribor3m::numeric, 2),
    nr_employed = ROUND(nr_employed::numeric, 2),
    marital = LOWER(marital),
    education = LOWER(education),
    "default" = LOWER("default"),
    housing = LOWER(housing),
    loan = LOWER(loan),
    contact = LOWER(contact),
    month = LOWER(month),
    day_of_week = LOWER(day_of_week),
    poutcome = LOWER(poutcome),
    y = LOWER(y);
```

<h4>Validating and Further Cleansing Data with Python</h4>

```python
# SQL query to fetch all data from the cleaned table
query = "SELECT * FROM bank_marketing_campaign"

# Load the cleaned data into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
print(df.head())

# Check for missing values in the dataset
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print(missing_values)

# Check for duplicates
duplicates = df.duplicated().sum()
print(f"Number of duplicate rows: {duplicates}")

# List of all categorical columns in the dataset
categorical_columns = ['job', 'education', 'marital', 'default', 'housing', 'loan', 
                       'contact', 'month', 'day_of_week', 'poutcome', 'y']

# Check for unique values in each categorical column
for column in categorical_columns:
    print(f"Unique values in {column}: {df[column].unique()}")

# Check for leading or trailing spaces in all categorical columns
rows_with_spaces = df[categorical_columns].apply(lambda x: x.str.strip() != x).any(axis=1)

# Display rows with leading or trailing spaces
print(df[rows_with_spaces])
```

<h2>3. Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

<p>
    After the data was cleaned, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to understand trends, distributions, and correlations in the dataset. Key tasks included:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Examining individual features like age, job type, and campaign success to understand their distribution.</li>
    <li>Investigating relationships between features such as the correlation between `age` and `y` (campaign success), or `job` and `y`.</li>
    <li>Using bar charts, histograms, and box plots to visualise distributions and relationships between features. For example, visualising how campaign success varies by job type or age group.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The goal of EDA was to uncover patterns and provide a deeper understanding of the dataset that could inform the creation of the final dashboard and key insights and recommendations.
</p>

<p>Below are a couple examples of visualisations from the EDA. You can find all the visualisations along with the corresponding source code here.</p>

<h4>Age Distribution of Customers</h4>
<p>
    This histogram shows the distribution of customer ages. The peak is around the 30-40 age range, which is valuable for identifying the core customer demographic.
</p>

```python
## 1.1. Plot the distribution of 'age'
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.histplot(df['age'], kde=True, bins=30)
plt.title('Age Distribution of Customers')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

<h4>Consumer Confidence Index vs. Campaign Success</h4>
<p>
    This box plot reveals how campaigns performed based on the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI). It indicates that campaigns are generally more successful when consumer confidence is higher.
</p>

```python
## 3.3. Explore the relationship between 'cons_conf_idx' and campaign success
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='y', y='cons_conf_idx', data=df)
plt.title('Consumer Confidence Index vs. Campaign Success')
plt.xlabel('Campaign Success')
plt.ylabel('Consumer Confidence Index')  # Descriptive y-axis label
plt.show()
```

<h3>Key Findings from the EDA</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Demographics:</b> The majority of customers are between 30-40 years old, suggesting a primary target market for campaigns.</li>
    <li><b>Campaign Duration:</b> Most campaigns are brief, and shorter campaigns tend to have higher success rates.</li>
    <li><b>Economic Factors:</b> The Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) and Employment Variation Rate are significant factors that impact campaign success.</li>
    <li><b>Customer Segmentation:</b> The dataset shows a wide range of job types, with "admin" and "technician" being the most common, helping to tailor customer segmentation strategies.</li>
</ul>


<h2>4. Data Visualisation</h2>

<p>
    The final stage of the project involved creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to communicate the insights derived from the analysis. The dashboard was designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to explore various aspects of the marketing campaign's success. Key features of the dashboard included:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Campaign performance:</b> Displaying the total number of successful term deposit sign-ups, and how success varied by demographics, job types, and months.</li>
    <li><b>Trend analysis:</b> Showing how campaign success changed over time, such as by month and day of the week.</li>
    <li><b>Interactivity:</b> Incorporating slicers for demographics, job types, and months, allowing users to filter and explore the data from different angles.</li>
    <li><b>Key insights:</b> Displaying insights based on the EDA phase, such as which job types had the highest success rates and which months saw more conversions.</li>
</ul>
